Full Stack Application setup, practice through repetition.

1) create package.json with:
    npm init -y
    
2) install depencencies for backend, db, server, middleware
    npm i mongoose express cors

3)
    create server.js file

4)  install dotenv for credentials
    npm i dotenv

5) create a server folder
    inside of server folder create 4 more folders,
        server > config, controllers, models, routes.

6)
    establish front-end with:
        npm create-react-app client

7) cd into client folder
    cd client

8) install axios for making request in our client:
    npm i axios react-router-dom@5
        -- consider learning the react18 version of this.

9) within client, create a new components folder
        within components create: 
            Main.js
        Where you can import {useEffect, useState} from react and axios.

STEP TWO, ESTABLISH THE SCHEMA OR DATABASE
WE CAN TEST IN POSTMAN PRIOR TO DOING THE FRONT-END
Keep it simple at first
